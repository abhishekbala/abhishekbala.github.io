          <p>In most holy places, the deity can be found atop a hill. However, at Girivalam in Thiruvannamalai, the Holy hill, Arunachala, is the deity itself.</p>
		  <p>Legend has it that when Lord Vishnu and Lord Brahma were disputing over who was superior, Lord Shiva challenged them by appearing as a massive column of light and asking them to measure the gigantic flaming linga.
		  Brahma assumed the form of a swan and searched the skies, while Vishnu assumed the form of a boar and searched into the earth.
		  Neither Brahma nor Vishnu were successful in their search; however, Brahma lied that he had seen the uppermost limit of the column. When Brahma confronted Vishnu, Shiva emerged from the central portion of the pillar and explained that both of them were born from Lord Shiva.
		  Angry with Brahma for lying, Shiva cursed Brahma that no one would ever pray to him. This explains why there are hardly any temples dedicated to Brahma in India.</p>
		  <p>The night Shiva emerged from the pillar is celebrated as Shivarathri. To celebrate the occasion, devotees of Lord Shiva fast during the day and pray to the Lord throughout the night.</p>
		  <p>Similarly, at Thiruvannamali, devotees come to perform a nightlong pradakshinam by walking 14 km. around the Arunachala hill. During this walk, devotees will encounter small temples with 8 different lingas.</p>
